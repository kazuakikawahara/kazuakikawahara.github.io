An all‐solid‐state fluoride‐ion battery (FIB) is one of the promising candidates for the next‐generation battery owing to its high energy density and high safety. For the practical application of FIBs, it is an urgent task to operate FIBs at lower temperatures. However, there are still two major difficulties in conventional conversion‐type pure metal cathodes: low F<sup>−</sup> ion conductivities and poor cycle stabilities. Here, the conversion‐type Sn‐based intermetallic alloy is proposed as a new cathode that can overcome the above issues. The present CoSn<sub>2</sub> cathode retains the discharge capacity of 229 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> after 250 cycles, even at 60 °C. CoSn<sub>2</sub> is decomposed into CoF<sub>2</sub> and SnF<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals in the charging process, and the nanoscale network structure of SnF<sub>2</sub> provides the fast F<sup>−</sup> ion conduction path throughout the cathode, facilitating the battery operation at lower temperatures. Moreover, the formed CoF<sub>2</sub> and SnF<sub>2</sub> phases are merged into the original CoSn<sub>2</sub> phase in the discharging process, leading to a highly reversible redox reaction and the high cycle stability of CoSn<sub>2</sub>.

 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables direct determination of atomic arrangements in materials and devices. However, materials such as battery components are weak for electron beam irradiation, and low electron doses are required to prevent beam-induced damages. Noise removal is thus essential for precise structural analysis of electron-beam-sensitive materials at atomic resolution. Total square variation (TSV) regularization is an algorithm that exhibits high noise removal performance. However, the use of the TSV regularization term leads to significant image blurring and intensity reduction. To address these problems, we here propose a new approach adopting L2 norm regularization based on higher-order total variation. An atomic-resolution STEM image can be approximated as a set of smooth curves represented by quadratic functions. Since the third-degree derivative of any quadratic function is 0, total third-degree variation (TTDV) is suitable for a regularization term.

 All solid-state fluoride ion batteries are considered to be high energy density and safe energy storage devices. However, the F– ion conductivities of solid electrolytes at room temperature are low (&lt; 10-6 S cm-1), which requires the higher operating temperature of fluoride ion battery such as 420 K or higher. Therefore, the faster F– ion conductors is strongly desired to operate fluoride ion battery at lower or even room temperature. KSbF4 is one of the promising candidates to have a faster F– ion conductivity. To expand F– ion conduction pathways, we doped Rb in KSbF4 and further investigated the compositional dependence of ionic conductivity in K1-xRbxSbF4 system. We found that ionic conductivity strongly depends on the chemical composition and conductivity was maximized at x = 0.15.

 Atomic-resolution electron microscopy imaging of solid-state material is a powerful method for structural analysis. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the actively used techniques to directly observe atoms in materials. However, some materials are easily damaged by the electron beam irradiation, and only noisy images are available when we decrease the electron dose to avoid beam damages. Therefore, a denoising process is necessary for precise structural analysis in low-dose STEM. In this study, we propose total variation (TV) denoising algorithm to remove quantum noise in an STEM image. We defined an entropy of STEM image that corresponds to the image contrast to determine a hyperparameter and we found that there is a hyperparameter that maximizes the entropy. We acquired atomic-resolution STEM image of CaF2 viewed along the [001] direction and executed TV denoising. The atomic columns of Ca and F are clearly visualized by the TV denoising, and atomic positions of Ca and F are determined with the error of ±1 pm and ±4 pm, respectively.",null,"Oxford University Press (OUP)",2022-06-17,null,Microscopy,71,5,302,310,null,true,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/jmicro/dfac032,2050-5698,2050-5701,https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jmicro/dfac032/44512771/dfac032.pdf,https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article-pdf/71/5/302/46350290/dfac032.pdf,false,disclosed

To gain insights into this behavior, in this report we analyze changes in epitaxial LiMn2O4 thin films during the first few charge-discharge cycles with atomic resolution and correlate them with changes in the electrochemical properties. Impedance spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy are used to show that defect-rich LiMn2O4 surfaces contribute greatly to the increased resistivity of the battery after only a single charge. Sequences of {111} stacking faults within the films were also observed upon charging, increasing in number with further cycling. The atomic structures of these stacking faults are reported for the first time, showing that Li deintercalation is accompanied by local oxygen loss and relaxation of Mn atoms onto previously unoccupied sites. The stacking faults have a more compressed structure than the spinel matrix and impede Li-ion migration, which explains the observed increase in thin-film resistivity as the number of cycles increases.

The novel properties such as the quantum spin Hall effect and the compatibility with the current Si device technologies have fueled competition to realize the silicene. This review article focuses on the geometric and electronic structures of silicene grown on Ag(111) investigated by scanning tunneling microcopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The silicene on Ag(111) takes locally-buckled structure in which the Si atoms are displaced perpendicularly to the basal plane. As a result, several superstructures such as 4 x 4, root 13 x root 13R13.9 degrees,4/root 3 x 4/root 3, and etc. emerge. The atomic arrangement of the 4 x 4 silicene has been determined by STM, DFT calculations and LEED dynamical analysis, while the other superstructures remain to be fully-resolved. In the 4 x 4 silicene, Si atoms are arranged to form a buckled honeycomb structure where six Si atoms of 18 Si atoms in the unit cell are displaced vertically. The displacements lead to the vertical shift of the substrate Ag atoms, indicating the non-negligible coupling at the interface between the silicene layer and the substrate. The interface coupling significantly modifies the electronic structure of the 4 x 4 silicene. No Landau level sequences were observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) with magnetic fields applied perpendicularly to the sample surface. The DFT calculations showed that the pi and pi* bands derived from the Si 3p(z) are hybridized with the Ag electronic states, leading to the drastic modification in the band structure and then the absence of Dirac fermion features together with the two-dimensionality in the electronic states. These findings demonstrate that the strong coupling at the interface causes the symmetry breaking for the 4 x 4 silicene and as a result the disappearance of Dirac fermion features. The geometric and electronic structures of other superstructures are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Si - Si bond lengths range from 2.29 to 2.31 angstrom, which are close to the upper limit of Si=Si double bond and shorter than the bond length in the bulk diamond structure. The buckling in the silicene layer causes the displacement of Ag atoms in the first substrate layer with 0.3 angstrom perpendicular to the surface, which is a compelling evidence of the strong couplings at the interface between the silicene and the substrate.

I am currently engaged in the development of materials for fluoride batteries. Fluoride batteries are theoretically expected to exhibit higher energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, their practical application faces significant challenges, particularly due to the low ionic conductivity of the materials. To address this, I am synthesizing and analyzing fast fluoride ionic conductors. In addition, I am also working on the development of new data analysis methods, leveraging Bayesian statistics and informatics, to enable more precise characterization of these materials.
